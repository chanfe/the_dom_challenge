# the_dom_challenge
I am redoing past small project I worked on.  It is a site that can like, comment, increment/decrement, and pause on the counter.

## Deliverables

1. As a user, i should see the timer increment every second once the page has loaded
2. As a user, i can manually increment and decrement the counter as i like
3. As a user, i can like an individual number of the counter. I should see the appropriate number of likes associated with that particular number
4. As a user I can pause the game, which should disable all buttons except the pause button, which should now show the text 'resume'
5. As a user I can leave comments on my gameplay, such as "Wow, what a fun game this is"
